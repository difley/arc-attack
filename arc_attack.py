    reading

    basic_api.py: definitions of functions for calculating
    arcs and line segments

    config.py: the configuration file used by main.py

    main.py: the entry point for a demonstration of
    building a random sequence of arcs and line segments

    random_path.py: definitions of functions for
    constructing random sequences of arcs and line
    segments
